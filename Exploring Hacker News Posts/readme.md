# Exploring Hacker News Posts

This projects was a quick analysis of an Hacker News data set from 2016.

## Dataset:

This data set is Hacker News posts **from the last 12 months of the year 2016**.It includes the following columns:

- title: title of the post (self explanatory)

- url: the url of the item being linked to

- num_points: the number of upvotes the post received

- num_comments: the number of comments the post received

- author: the name of the account that made the post

- created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)


## Context:

Hacker News is a popular technology site that was started by Y Combinator. Users submit stories (a post) and vote and/comment upon. Most popular posts arrive at the top and can get over 100k visitors as a result. Publications are under strict [guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html) and it is not easy to stand out. 

We will try here to determine at what time posts should be posted in the hopes of getting the more *Up Votes* and *Comments* and become popular. 

## Purpose of the project: 

Cleaning data process using Python. Most of the project purpose was to show my skills in data cleaning and date formating in order to get a dataset ready for analysis. **Pandas and Numpy were not used in this project**.
