# Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

This projects was a quick analysis of the Ebay Mortors German website data set from 2016.

## Context:

In this project, we will analyze an dataset from eBay Kleinanzeigen. The dataset is too heavy to be important on Github, it can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/download). It was cleaned in advance for the purpose of the analysis. This data set was scraped in 2016 (this analysis was made on August 2020). If a new data set were to be prepared this year, data could be entirely different.

The data set is composed of the following columns:

dateCrawled - When this ad was first crawled. All field-values are taken from this date.
