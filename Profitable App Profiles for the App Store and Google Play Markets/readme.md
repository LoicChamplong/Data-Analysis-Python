# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This projects was intentionally done in Python codes without the use of [Pandas](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics) or [Numpy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp). It was incredibly challenging. The analysis relies on two data sets, one gathers data on the Google Play Store and the other one on the Apple Store. 

## The data sets

Both data sets can be downloaded in the files. 

## Context 

In this project, I endorsed the role of a data analyst working for app-building company. Our apps are available on the Apple Store and Google play-store. 

Our business model consists in delevering viral free apps for the general public. Our revenues are from in-app ads and depend heavily on the popularity of our apps and the number our people that use them. 

**Goal**: 

Our purpose here is to analyze our dataset and help our developers understand the type of aps that are the most likely to attract more users.

This is an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), or also called a market research.
