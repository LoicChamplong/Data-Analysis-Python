## Project Description

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I analyzed data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I also performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
