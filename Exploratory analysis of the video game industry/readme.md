# Exploratory Analysis of the Video Game Industry 

This is my very first solo project in Python. No Machine Learning was involved as the data could not allow it. 

This project is dedicated to the video game industry from 1980 to 2020. It aims at understanding its specifications and why it is a complicated one. 

Most questions were related to the study of local and global sales (from the US to Japan). We also wondered who was the leader in this complex industry only to find out that the market was actually divided into 5 powerful companies. The data clearly shows an equilibirum. 

The dataset is from Kaggle and Python was used to do the analysis. No special techniques were used as it is data manipulation techniques.
